1.	
	outcome(_, []) is the base case
	outcome([_, E | L], [E | M]) :- !,outcome(L, M).recursively called this rule.

	_ = a, E = b, L = [c, d, e, f, g]
	_ = c, E = d, L =[e, f, g]
	_ = e, E = f, L = [g],E|M = []
	reach the base case.
	so,
	X = [b,d,f]
2.
(a) this case is to produce a new list by picking even index from old list(assuming first element index in old list is 1).
(b) search for X ig find one result in database then stop backtracking, and respond right away. 
(c)Because each of variables only occurs once, we use it just to transmit information,so we can use anonymous variables.
